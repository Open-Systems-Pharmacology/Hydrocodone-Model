# Hydrocodone-Model
**_The whole-body PBPK model for hydrocodone, a widely used opioid analgesic._**

## Repository files
**_Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body PBPK model of hydrocodone, which has CYP3A4-mediated and non-CYP-mediated clearance. The model was assessed using observed data on hydrocodone pharmacokinetics with various dosing protocols. This model also contains hydromorphone, a metabolite of hydrocodone through CYP2D6 metabolic pathway. The detailed information on model development and evaluation was described in [1]_**
